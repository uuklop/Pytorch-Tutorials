A tensor is a way to represent data in a structured and organized format. You can think of it as a generalization of concepts you're already familiar with:

Why Are Tensors Important?
Tensors are used in machine learning and deep learning because:

Efficient Storage: Tensors can store and organize data in a compact way.
Mathematical Operations: Tensors can be easily manipulated using mathematical operations (like addition, multiplication, etc.).
Flexibility: Tensors can represent data of any shape or dimension, making them versatile for modeling complex systems like images (3D tensors), videos (4D tensors), or text.
